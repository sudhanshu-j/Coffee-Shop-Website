# Coffee-Shop-Website

Overview

    Coffee-Shop-Website is a fully responsive web application designed to simulate the online presence of a coffee 
    shop. The website is built using standard web technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and 
    JavaScript for interactivity. The goal is to provide users with a simple, yet elegant interface to explore the 
    menu, learn more about the coffee shop, and possibly order online (if future features are implemented).

    • Blog Section: A page dedicated to the coffee shop’s story, values, and mission.
    
    • Contact Information: Basic contact details for the shop, including an embedded location map.

Technologies Used

    • HTML: Provides the structural foundation of the web pages.
