- **Products Section**: A grid of product cards, each with a title, price, and images.

### Footer Section:

## CSS Styling

The website is styled using CSS with the following notable features:

- **Typography**: The project uses the Roboto font from Google Fonts for a modern and clean look.

- **Color Scheme**:

  - **Primary Color**: A warm, golden color (#d3ad7f).

  - **Secondary Color**: A dark shade of gray (#13131a) used for the background and text.

  - **Background Color**: The background of the page is set to a very dark black (#010103).

- **Layout**:

  - Flexbox is used for centering elements and creating responsive layouts.

  - The grid layout is applied to sections like the Menu, Products, and Blogs for a modern, adaptive design.

- **Media Queries**: Used to adapt the design to different screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).

### Media Queries Breakdown

- For screens wider than 768px: Basic layout.

- For screens 768px or smaller: The hamburger menu is activated, and the navbar turns into a vertical sidebar.

- For screens 450px or smaller: Further optimizations for mobile devices.

- For screens 380px or smaller: Additional tweaks for ultra-small devices like phones in portrait mode.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the page. Here are the key features implemented in JavaScript:

### Elements:

- **Navbar**: Handles the visibility of the main navigation menu.

- **Search Form**: Controls the toggle behavior for the search bar.

- **Cart Container**: Manages the visibility of the shopping cart.

### Event Listeners:

- **Hamburger Menu Toggle**: Clicking on the hamburger icon (`#menu-btn`) will show or hide the navbar on small screens.

- **Search Form Toggle**: Clicking on the search button (`#search-btn`) will show or hide the search form.

- **Cart Toggle**: Clicking on the cart button (`#cart-btn`) will show or hide the cart container.

- **Scroll Behavior**: When the user scrolls down, the navbar, search form, and cart container are automatically closed, improving the user experience.

```bash
let navbar = document.querySelector(".navbar");
let searchForm = document.querySelector(".search-form");
let cartItem = document.querySelector(".cart-items-container");

// Hamburger menu toggle
document.querySelector("#menu-btn").onclick = () => {
  navbar.classList.toggle("active");
  searchForm.classList.remove("active");
  cartItem.classList.remove("active");
};

// Search form toggle
document.querySelector("#search-btn").onclick = () => {
  searchForm.classList.toggle("active");
  navbar.classList.remove("active");
  cartItem.classList.remove("active");
};

// Cart items toggle
document.querySelector("#cart-btn").onclick = () => {
  cartItem.classList.toggle("active");
  navbar.classList.remove("active");
  searchForm.classList.remove("active");
};

// Close all on scroll
window.onscroll = () => {
  navbar.classList.remove("active");
  searchForm.classList.remove("active");
  cartItem.classList.remove("active");
};
```

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the page. Here are the key features implemented in JavaScript:

### Behavior:

- **Hamburger Menu**: Clicking the hamburger menu toggles the visibility of the navigation bar.

- **Search Button**: Clicking the search button opens or closes the search form, hiding the navbar and cart.

- **Cart Button**: Clicking the cart button opens or closes the shopping cart, hiding the navbar and search form.

- **Scroll Behavior**: If the user scrolls, all pop-ups (navbar, search form, cart) close automatically.

## Customization

### Colors

- **Primary Color**: The primary color is used for buttons, highlights, and interactive elements. You can change the color by modifying the `--primary-color` variable in the `:root` section of `styles.css`.

#### Example:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #d3ad7f; /* Change this value to customize the primary color */
}
```

### Background Color

- **Background Color**: Modify the background color of the body and other sections by changing the `--bg` and `--secondary-color` variables.

#### Example:

```css
:root {
    --bg: #f0f0f0; /* Change this value to customize the background color */
    --secondary-color: #ffffff; /* Change this value for secondary backgrounds */
}
```
### Fonts

- The project uses the Roboto font from Google Fonts. If you'd like to change the font, replace the link in the <head> section of index.html with a new Google Fonts link, and update the font-family in the CSS.

### Example:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YourNewFont&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

```css
body {
    font-family: 'YourNewFont', sans-serif; /* Update to your new font */
}
```

## Layout

- **Layout**: To change the layout, adjust the values in the `grid-template-columns` and `flex` properties found in the CSS for different sections like `.menu .box-container`, `.product .box-container`, and `.blogs .box-container`.

## Navbar and Menu

- **Navbar and Menu**: To add or remove links in the navigation menu, simply modify the `<a>` tags in the `<nav>` section of `index.html`.

## JavaScript

- **JavaScript**: You can easily modify the JavaScript to add more functionality, such as a search feature, product filters, or even dynamic content loading. The current script handles toggling of the navbar, search form, and cart container, but you can extend it as needed.
